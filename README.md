## Additional Information:
[![Standard-Js](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://standardjs.com/)

Due to external factors dictating time spent on the assessment, the styling of the website is not as responsive as I would have liked as a result, the website currently supports screens of 1920*1080 or >=23"

### Extra Modules Used in Part2
[StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) to make the project code more readable.

[materialize-css](https://materializecss.com) for adding style to the webapp

[react-materialize](https://github.com/react-materialize/react-materialize) to give design components for react
